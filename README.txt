Funding for Humanity

Developed a nonprofit crowdfunding site that will allow people across the world to raise money for the country in need, region in need, and people in need. It can be one country, but there might be different regions that may be in need for resources due to natural disasters and environmental factors. Funding for Humanity will have various postings through the site including person in need, region in need, and the world in need. 

Postings will be divided into three main sections where people in need, region in need, and world in need will have multiple unique stories posted horizontally throughout the site, allowing users to learn more about them and have the option to donate. Each post will be verified by going through internal testing criteria determined by an ethically certified team so the website will be very strict on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The site will rely on CIA triad to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability for this site to protect against data breaches and fraud. 

The Goal of Funding for Humanity is a crowdfunding platform to assist overcome challenges people are facing worldwide, including hunger, diseases, natural disasters, war recovery and more. According to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty. Each year we will assist hundreds/thousands of people to fight these challenges by providing necessary resources that people are in need of. We hope to target celebrities and the public for donations to overcome these challenges. 

HTML tags will allow us to add paragraphs, headers, pictures, bullets, forms and other pieces to post creative content on the site. However, to make the site look alive and interactive we will use CSS to add colors, fonts, layout, and background images. To accomplish site’s creativity and attractiveness, PHP will be used to add dynamic web pages. We will also use SQL to store user’s information, payment information, and post information to allow payment processing possible for the site. We will use AJAX along with JavaScript to create fast and dynamic web pages to allow pages to be updated asynchronously.
